Josh Blanchette's FP2 report.

START

Hello. I used a plot library, and messed around with certain plots and shapes to see what I can produce.  At first, I just made a simple plot, just to get the feel of things.  The picture is below.

After I produced this graph successfully, I then got into more complex looking graphs.  I made a 'contour' graph, that required a simple inline lambda function.  This produced a, funky looking graph that has no relevance to data that matters, but it was still fun to play with.  The picture is below.



The code is straightforward, where as the syntax is easy to understand. Customizing the stickman reminded me of CSS properties we used back in GUI 1 and 2. The imports I used in my code are copied below.
